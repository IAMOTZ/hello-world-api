# Hello World Restful JSON API
This is a Hello World Restful JSON API built with NodeJS alone ie without any NPM package, it does not even have a `package.json`.  
It is very surprising that most developers that claim to know NodeJS can't implement a simple Hello World API without using one NPM package or the other.   
The reason for this is mostly due to how tightly coupled NPM and NodeJS are, however, it shouldn't be too difficult to realize that NodeJS and NPM are two separate entities and it is in the best interest of their uses to keep them separate.  
NodeJS is powerful, the documentation is huge, it has a lot of super cool APIs but most of its users are completely unaware of this, instead, they are continuously overwhelmed with the unending list of NPM modules published every day.  
**ADVICE**: Take time to learn NodeJS, it's really cool. Become a *NodeJS Developer* and not just an *NPM developers*

## If you want to play around the project
* clone the repo.
* change into the project directory
* run `$ node index.js` to start the app on port 8000
* send a `POST` request to local `localhost:8000/` to see the 'Hello World!' message.

## How this program came to be?
I like to include this section in most of my personal projects/programs. It reminds me(and inform you) of what made me built the project. 
This simple project is one of the assignments given in the [NodeJS Master Class Course](https://pirple.thinkific.com/courses/the-nodejs-master-class#cst-v2-section-ad04065c69) I am currently taking.
